# 📊 Interim Project — Adventure Works (2019)

## Collaborative Data Analysis using SQL & Python

This project explores the **Adventure Works 2019** dataset to uncover key operational, HR, and financial drivers across a global retail company. Using SQL for data extraction and Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for exploratory data analysis, our team conducted correlation, segmentation, and performance analyses to identify the factors that influence store revenue, employee behavior, and overall business performance.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This group project analyzed large-scale sales, HR, and store operational data to answer questions such as:

- **What drives revenue performance** across different geographic markets?  
- **How do HR metrics** like sick leave or job type, relate to employee productivity?  
- **Do store characteristics** (size, employee count) meaningfully influence profitability?  

Our investigation focused on uncovering patterns, correlations, and actionable insights to support data-driven business decisions.

## 🔑 Key Insights

- The USA leads in **absolute revenue ($25M+)**, while Canada leads in **revenue per inhabitant**, showing stronger per-capita engagement.  
- Sales representatives take **significantly less sick leave** than office-based staff — suggesting better work-life balance in field roles.  
- Manual-labor departments show **higher sick leave**, signaling potential ergonomic or physical strain.  
- Larger stores employ more people (expected), but **store size does not drive revenue**, challenging typical retail assumptions.  
- Scatter plot analysis shows a **weak correlation** between employee count and revenue, meaning strategic staffing and location matter more than store size.

## 🛠 Methodology

### 1. Data Extraction & Preparation
- Queried Adventure Works 2019 using SQL to gather sales, HR, and store datasets  
- Joined multiple tables to build unified analysis-ready datasets  
- Engineered features for HR metrics, store performance, and revenue indicators  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned, aggregated, and filtered data using Pandas  
- Calculated correlation coefficients  
- Identified relationships across HR, operational, and financial dimensions  

### 3. Visualization & Communication
- Created Matplotlib visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts, line graphs)  
- Highlighted business implications through visual storytelling  
- Presented findings to peers and mentor through a structured narrative
